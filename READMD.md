# Go Learning Repository

This repository is primarily for learning the Go programming language in preparation for developing a new service at work.  
Please note that this is **not** an actively maintained personal project, and it is **not** intended for production use or public contribution.

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Practice Go basics and idiomatic patterns
- Explore packages and tooling that may be used in an upcoming internal project
- Document findings and useful references during the learning process

Because this repository is tied to work-related preparation, it will not be updated regularly outside that context.

**Note for interviewers**:  
This is a learning-focused repository to support a new service I'm helping to build in my current job. It is not representative of a polished or deployed personal project.
